# Financial Statement Field Mapping Configuration
# ============================================================================
# This file defines how input field names (from Excel, CSV, JSON) map to
# the engine's internal schema. Each internal field has a list of accepted
# aliases. Matching is case-insensitive and ignores underscores/hyphens/spaces.
#
# To customize: copy this file, add your model's specific labels as aliases,
# and pass the config path to the parser:
#   python main.py model.xlsx --mapping my_mapping.yaml
#
# Matching priority:
#   1. Exact match (after normalization)
#   2. Alias match
#   3. Fuzzy match (configurable threshold, default 85%)
# ============================================================================

settings:
  # Fuzzy matching threshold (0-100). Set to 0 to disable fuzzy matching.
  fuzzy_threshold: 85
  # Whether to treat the first row/column as headers
  header_row: true
  # How to handle unmapped fields: "ignore", "warn", "error"
  unmapped_fields: warn
  # Normalize signs: some models use positive values for expenses/outflows
  # Set to true to auto-detect and flip signs based on context
  auto_sign_normalization: true
